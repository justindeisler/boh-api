# Monitoring and Observability Guidelines

This file provides guidance when implementing monitoring and observability for the event management platform. Follow these standards to detect issues early, diagnose problems quickly, and maintain system reliability.

## Important: Proactive Monitoring Requirements

**MANDATORY**: Implement comprehensive monitoring before launch. Never deploy to production without monitoring. Set up alerting for critical metrics with on-call rotation. Monitor user-facing metrics, not just server metrics. Establish baseline performance metrics and alert on deviations. Treat monitoring as a core feature, not an afterthought.

## Observability Philosophy

**Event Management Observability** implements the three pillars of observability: metrics, logs, and traces. The system prioritizes actionable alerts, low-overhead collection, and self-hosted solutions for cost control and data sovereignty. Monitoring focuses on user-facing metrics and business outcomes, not just technical metrics.

## Three Pillars of Observability

### Metrics, Logs, and Traces

**Overall Grade: A+** - Complete observability requires all three pillars working together.

**Metrics (What is Happening):**
- Numerical measurements over time
- Aggregated system health indicators
- Low storage overhead
- Fast to query and visualize
- Examples: request rate, error rate, response time

**Logs (Detailed Events):**
- Discrete events with context
- Detailed information about specific occurrences
- High storage overhead
- Rich debugging information
- Examples: error messages, user actions, API calls

**Traces (Request Journey):**
- Follow requests through distributed systems
- Track latency across services
- Identify bottlenecks in request flow
- Essential for microservices
- Examples: API request through multiple services

**Why All Three:**
- Metrics identify problems exist
- Logs provide context and details
- Traces show where problems occur
- Together enable root cause analysis
- Comprehensive system understanding

## Metrics Collection with Prometheus

### Why Prometheus

**Overall Grade: A+** - Prometheus is the industry standard for metrics collection.

**Prometheus Benefits:**
- Time-series database optimized for metrics

### Metric Naming Conventions

**Overall Grade: A** - Consistent naming improves query writing and understanding.

**Naming Pattern:**
- Format: `{namespace}_{subsystem}_{metric}_{unit}`
- Example: `api_http_requests_total`
- Example: `database_query_duration_seconds`
- Example: `business_bookings_created_total`

**Best Practices:**
- ✅ Use underscores (not hyphens)
- ✅ End with unit suffix (_seconds, _bytes, _total)
- ✅ Use base units (seconds not milliseconds)
- ✅ Counter names end with _total
- ✅ Keep names descriptive but concise
- ❌ Don't use camelCase or hyphens
- ❌ Avoid abbreviations unless standard
- ❌ Never include variable data in metric names

### Histograms vs Summaries

**Overall Grade: A+** - Choose the right metric type for accurate measurements.

**Histograms:**

**Summaries:**
- Calculate percentiles client-side
- Exact percentiles but not aggregatable
- Lower server load
- Good for client-side libraries
- Use when aggregation not needed

**When to Use Each:**
- **Histogram**: Response times, request sizes (preferred)
- **Summary**: Client-side metrics, exact percentiles
- **Default to histograms** for aggregatable metrics
