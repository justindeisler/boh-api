# Security Guidelines

This file provides guidance when implementing security measures for the event management platform with integrated CMS. Follow these standards to protect user data, prevent common vulnerabilities, and ensure compliance with security best practices.

## Important: Security-First Development

**MANDATORY**: Security must be implemented from the start, not added later. All user input must be validated server-side. Never trust client-side validation. Implement authentication and authorization before exposing any sensitive endpoints. Follow the principle of least privilege for all system access. Protect admin CMS endpoints with strict role-based access control.

## Security Philosophy

**Event Management Security** implements defense-in-depth with multiple security layers including authentication, authorization, input validation, rate limiting, and comprehensive monitoring. The system follows OWASP Top 10 guidelines and implements security best practices across frontend, backend, and infrastructure. Special attention is given to protecting the admin CMS, which provides elevated privileges for content and system management.

## Authentication and Authorization

### Token-Based Authentication

**Overall Grade: A+** - JWT with refresh tokens provides secure stateless authentication.

**Why JWT Tokens:**
- Stateless authentication (no server-side sessions)
- Self-contained with user claims
- Cryptographically signed (prevents tampering)
- Can be verified without database lookup
- Works across distributed services
- Includes role information for RBAC

**Access Token Design:**
- Short lifetime: 15-30 minutes maximum
- Store in memory only (never localStorage)
- Contains minimal claims (user ID, role only)
- Signed with strong secret (256-bit minimum)
- No sensitive data in payload (JWTs are not encrypted)
- Include role claim for authorization checks

**Refresh Token Design:**
- Longer lifetime: 7 days maximum
- Store in httpOnly cookies only
- Include secure flag (HTTPS only)
- Set sameSite=strict (CSRF protection)
- Rotate on each use (invalidate old tokens)
- Store hash in database for revocation

**Token Security Rules:**
- ✅ Use strong signing algorithm (HS256 minimum, RS256 preferred)
- ✅ Validate signature on every request
- ✅ Check expiration timestamp
- ✅ Verify issuer and audience claims
- ✅ Implement token revocation mechanism
- ✅ Include role in access token payload
- ❌ Never store access tokens in localStorage (XSS vulnerable)
- ❌ Never include passwords or sensitive data in payload
- ❌ Don't use weak signing secrets

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

**Overall Grade: A+** - Proper RBAC prevents unauthorized access to sensitive operations.

**Role Hierarchy:**
- **USER**: Basic authenticated user
  - Can book events
  - Manage own bookings
  - View own profile
  - Cannot access admin endpoints

- **ORGANIZER**: Event creator
  - All USER permissions
  - Create and manage own events
  - View own event analytics
  - Cannot access CMS endpoints
  - Cannot manage other users

- **ADMIN**: System administrator
  - All USER and ORGANIZER permissions
  - Full CMS access (content, media, settings)
  - Manage all events (any organizer)
  - Manage all users
  - System configuration access

**RBAC Implementation:**
- Check role immediately after authentication
- Verify role matches endpoint requirements
- Return 403 Forbidden for insufficient permissions
- Log all authorization failures
- Never expose role checks to client

**Role Verification Best Practices:**
- ✅ Verify role on every protected request
- ✅ Check at controller/route level (not business logic)
- ✅ Fail closed (deny by default)
- ✅ Log authorization attempts
- ✅ Use decorators/guards for consistency
- ❌ Never trust client-provided role claims
- ❌ Don't check permissions in frontend only
- ❌ Avoid hardcoding role checks in business logic

### Resource Ownership Authorization

**Overall Grade: A+** - Ownership checks prevent lateral privilege escalation.

**Ownership Patterns:**

**ORGANIZER Ownership Rules:**
- Can only modify own events (check authorId)
- Can only view bookings for own events
- Cannot access other organizers' data
- Ownership verified in database query

**USER Ownership Rules:**
- Can only view/modify own bookings
- Can only update own profile
- Cannot access other users' data
- Ownership enforced server-side

**ADMIN Bypass:**
- ADMIN role bypasses ownership checks
- Full access to all resources
- Actions logged for audit trail
- Use with caution and monitoring

**Ownership Check Implementation:**
- Verify ownership in database query (not application)
- Use WHERE clauses to filter by owner
- Return 403 if user attempts unauthorized access
- Log ownership violations
- Test thoroughly for privilege escalation

**Example Patterns:**
- Event update: Check authorId = currentUserId (ORGANIZER) or role = ADMIN
- Booking view: Check userId = currentUserId or event.authorId = currentUserId (ORGANIZER) or role = ADMIN
- Profile update: Check id = currentUserId (USER) or role = ADMIN

### Password Security

**Overall Grade: A+** - Proper password handling prevents credential breaches.

**Password Storage:**
- Use bcrypt for password hashing (cost factor 12-14)
- Never store plain-text passwords
- Never log passwords (even hashed)
- Salt automatically included in bcrypt
- Hash before storing in database

**Password Requirements:**
- Minimum 8 characters (12+ recommended)
- Require mix of character types
- Check against common password lists
- No maximum length limit (within reason: 128 chars)
- Allow all special characters

**Password Reset Flow:**
- Generate cryptographically random token
- Store token hash in database (not plain token)
- Set short expiration (1 hour maximum)
- Invalidate after use
- Send reset link via email only
- Never expose user existence in error messages

**Admin Password Requirements:**
- Enforce stronger passwords for ADMIN role (minimum 12 characters)
- Require periodic password changes (every 90 days)
- Prevent password reuse (last 5 passwords)
- Enable multi-factor authentication (recommended)
- Monitor failed admin login attempts

**Best Practices:**
- ✅ Implement rate limiting on authentication
- ✅ Lock accounts after repeated failures
- ✅ Log authentication attempts
- ✅ Notify users of password changes
- ✅ Support multi-factor authentication
- ✅ Enforce stronger requirements for privileged roles
- ❌ Never email passwords to users
- ❌ Don't enforce frequent password changes (causes weak passwords)

## Content Security Policy (CSP)

### XSS Prevention

**Overall Grade: A+** - Multiple layers prevent XSS attacks.

**XSS Attack Types:**

**Stored XSS (Most Critical for CMS):**
- Malicious content stored in database (content pages, sections)
- Executed when content displayed to users
- Most dangerous type (persistent)
- Prevent with output encoding and CSP
- High risk in CMS rich text content

**Reflected XSS:**
- Malicious content in URL parameters

- No user interaction required (automatic cookies)

**SameSite Cookie Strategy:**
- Set sameSite=strict on all cookies
- Prevents browsers sending cookies cross-origin
- Modern browsers support (95%+ coverage)
- Primary defense mechanism
- Works without per-request tokens

**SameSite Values:**
- **Strict**: Never send cross-origin (recommended for admin)
- **Lax**: Send on top-level navigation (GET only)
- **None**: Always send (requires Secure flag, avoid)

**Additional CSRF Protections:**
- Verify Origin and Referer headers
- Implement CSRF tokens for non-cookie auth
- Use custom headers (X-Requested-With)
- Require re-authentication for sensitive actions (admin operations)
- Log suspicious cross-origin requests

**Admin CMS CSRF Protection:**
- Strict SameSite cookies for admin sessions
- CSRF tokens for destructive operations
- Require password confirmation for critical actions
- Verify Origin header on all admin endpoints
- Monitor for CSRF attack patterns

**Best Practices:**
- ✅ Set sameSite=strict on authentication cookies
- ✅ Validate Origin header on state-changing requests
